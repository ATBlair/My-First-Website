                I grew up in West Jordan, UT. My father was an avid snake collector and breeder. At one pointe he had the largest snake collection in the United States. My job was to help keep the cages clean and the water bowls full. When I look back all I remember is snakes and basketball. I absolutely loved it; I studied the different species and soaked in all the information I could. When I wasn't working in the snake room I was playing basketball with friends. In my teenage years my interest in snakes fadded, and my love for basketball grew stronger.<br/>
                 Once I graduated High School I landed a job at Shriners Hospital for Children. It was one of the best 
                experiences of my life. The kids loved me and I had so much fun taking care of them in their time of need. I was amazed at how resilient thay all were. It inspired me and motivated me to be the best person I could be. No matter what these youngsters were going through they never complained or let it affect who they truly were. Their possitivity was contagious and I couldn't get enough.<br/>
                After the great experience at Shriners I decided to go on an adventure. I was nervous to go to far so I decided Denver, CO was a good middle ground; a bigger city to experience, but not too far away from home. I lined up a job and an appartment and headed, said my good byes and headed out.
